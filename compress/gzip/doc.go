/*
Package gzip provides an Encoder implementation that compresses and decompresses data using the gzip algorithm.

This package is designed to be used as a middleware encoder compress in the kivigo/encoders/compress framework, allowing you to transparently compress data before storage or transmission and decompress it on retrieval.

The gzip algorithm is a widely used compression method that offers a good balance between compression ratio and speed, making it suitable for general-purpose data compression in applications and services.

See the documentation for the Encoder type for more details.
